# **C++ Programming Exercises and Examples**

## **Overview**
This repository contains multiple C++ programming examples and exercises covering key concepts such as functions, operator overloading, templates, file handling, and class-based programming. The examples range from basic function implementations to advanced concepts like operator overloading, templates, and file input/output (I/O).

## **Detailed Explanation of Concepts**

### **1. Function Overloading and Parameter Passing (Example 1.1)**
- Demonstrates three ways to pass parameters:
  1. **Call by Value**: Directly passing variables; function returns the maximum.
  2. **Call by Reference**: Uses reference parameters (`&`) to store results.
  3. **Call by Pointer**: Uses pointers (`*`) to store results.

### **2. Classes and Operator Overloading**
- **Example 1.2**:
  - Defines a `Complex` class with constructors, getters, and a method to calculate magnitude.
  - Overloads the `+` operator for complex number addition.
  - Overloads the `=` operator for assignment.

- **Exercise 1.1**:
  - Overloads the `*` operator to correctly compute complex number multiplication.

### **3. Function and Class Templates**
- **Example 1.3**:
  - Introduces function templates using `GetMax()` to find the maximum of two numbers.

- **Example 1.4**:
  - Implements a class template `mypair<T>` that can store two values and return the maximum.

- **Exercise 1.2**:
  - Modifies `mypair<T>` to return the minimum instead of the maximum.

### **4. Templates with Fixed Array Size**
- **Example 1.5**:
  - Implements a template class `mysequence<T, N>` for storing a fixed-size array.
  - Methods allow setting and retrieving array elements.

- **Exercise 1.3**:
  - Extends `mysequence<T, N>` with methods to find the maximum and minimum values in an array.

### **5. File Handling in C++**
- **Example 1.6**:
  - Reads a file `fin.txt`, copies its contents to `fout.txt`, and counts characters.

- **Exercise 1.4**:
  - Enhances file handling by counting words, characters, and sentences.

### **6. Processing Student Data using File Handling**
- **Example 1.7**:
  - Reads student names and scores from `input.dat`, calculates averages, and writes them to `output.dat`.

### **7. Class-based Data Handling**
- **Exercise 1.5**:
  - Implements a `House` class with attributes like owner name, address, number of bedrooms, and price.
  - Allows users to input multiple house records and displays them in a tabular format.



## **Conclusion**
This repository provides a hands-on approach to learning key C++ concepts with real-world examples. It covers a wide range of topics from basic function handling to file operations, making it a valuable resource for learning object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++.
